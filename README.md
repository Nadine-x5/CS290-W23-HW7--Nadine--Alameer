 Riyadh Metro is one of the largest transportation projects in the Kingdom, designed to provide a modern and efficient transit system that reduces traffic congestion and enhances urban mobility. The metro operates through a comprehensive management system that organizes trips, calculates distances, and optimizes passenger movement.
 In our project, we developed a graph-based system to simulate route calculations within the metro network using an Adjacency Matrix. This representation allows for analyzing station connections, determining the shortest paths, and improving the commuting experience.
